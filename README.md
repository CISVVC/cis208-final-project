# cis208-final-project
Edit the file standard_dev.asm to calculate the standard deviation of the array of double values that is passed as a parameter.  There is some template code that has been created for this project, to get you started.  

The standard deviation is defined as the square root of the sum of the variants.

You can find more on the standard deviation at this location:
